Simple Factory

	- Create interfaces for your target [Product]
	- Create concrete implementations of your target [Concrete Product]
	- Create a factory class that returns one of the target [Creator]

	- You have two payment gateways:
		Esewa
		Khalti
	Create simple factory that returns the target based on the user preference [Can be hardcoded]

Factory Method Pattern

	- Create interfaces for your target [Product]
	- Create concrete implementations of your target [Concrete Product]
	- Create a factory interface/abstract base class that returns one of the target [Creator]
	- Create new factory classes that implement the above factory interface [ConcreteFactory]
		- Each implementation should return one of the ConcreteProduct

	- You have two payment gateways:
		Esewa
		Khalti
	Create simple factory that returns the target based on the user preference [Can be hardcoded]
